# Wage Differentials & “Model Minority Myth” Effects (UK)

## Goal
Evaluate whether the “model minority” myth is reflected in wage differentials by comparing White–Asian vs White–Black wage gaps in the UK.

## Methods
- Labor-economics framing (Borjas)
- Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition (explained vs unexplained components)
- OLS regressions with and without interaction terms

## Key findings (high level)
- White–Asian wage differential is smaller than White–Black.
- Characteristics aligned with “model minority” patterns are associated with higher returns to earnings.
